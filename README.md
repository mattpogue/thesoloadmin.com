# The Solo Admin - The Triumphs and Tragedies of IT Are Yours Alone

Hello! I'm Matt Pogue, proprietor of The Solo Admin blog - [https://thesoloadmin.com](https://thesoloadmin.com) - and GitHub repository. The blog is dedicated to - and oriented toward - folks who are either the lone IT staff or members of a small team working for small companies or on their own. 

The blog is always work in progress. I would love to hear your feedback and comments on the articles and code samples and any requests for new content. I've spent my entire career in IT and I've gotten so much from the folks that mentored me and trained me as well as the greater online community from which I've gotten so much knowledge over the years. Hopefully in some small way I can give back some of what I've received over the years.
