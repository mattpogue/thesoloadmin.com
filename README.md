# The Solo Admin - The Triumphs and Tragedies of IT Are Yours Alone

Hello! I'm Matt Pogue, proprietor of The Solo Admin blog - [https://thesoloadmin.com](https://thesoloadmin.com) - and GitHub repository. The blog is oriented toward - and dedicated to - folks who are either the sole IT staff or members of a small team, working for small companies or on their own. 

The blog is always work in progress. I welcome your feedback and comments on the articles and code samples, along with any requests for new content. 

The blog is about giving back some of the knowledge I've received over the years from folks that mentored me, as well as the online community at large, from which I've gotten so much over the years.
